# AI-Powered Business Performance & Market Insights Dashboard

**Overview:** End-to-end Business Analyst project that demonstrates:
- Data generation & ETL (CSV datasets)
- KPI calculation, simple forecasting (Python)
- SQL queries for common BA questions
- Streamlit dashboard for visualization and storytelling
- Business insights (report)

**How to run (locally):**
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the analysis script to compute KPIs & forecast:
   ```bash
   python notebooks/analysis.py
   ```
   This will generate `report/summary_kpis.csv` and `report/model_forecast.csv`.
3. Run the Streamlit dashboard:
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py
   ```

**Project structure:**
- data/ -> CSV datasets (sales.csv, customers.csv, competitors.csv)
- notebooks/ -> analysis.py (data transformation & simple forecasting)
- dashboard/ -> streamlit_app.py (interactive dashboard)
- sql/ -> queries.sql (use on a local DB if you import data)
- report/ -> generated outputs and summary
- README.md, requirements.txt

**What to include in a portfolio:** (short)
- Overview: problem statement, stakeholders, KPIs
- Tech stack: Python (pandas, sklearn), SQL, Streamlit, GitHub
- Key findings: include screenshots of dashboard + 1-page executive summary
- How you added value: e.g., "Identified top 3 low-performing SKUs and recommended price/promotions leading to simulated +8% revenue uplift."

## AI Forecasting Module

This project includes two forecasting approaches:

- **Linear Regression (baseline):** simple, transparent baseline model. Generated by `notebooks/analysis.py` and saved to `report/model_forecast.csv`.
- **Prophet (advanced):** industry-grade time-series forecasting with uncertainty intervals. If `prophet` is installed, `notebooks/analysis.py` will generate `report/prophet_forecast.csv` containing `ds, yhat, yhat_lower, yhat_upper`.

Run `python notebooks/analysis.py` locally after installing dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) to produce Prophet forecasts. The Streamlit dashboard includes an interactive horizon selector (3/6/12 months) and comparison charts.
